## MLOps Starter Kit
Welcome to my MLOps Starter Kit repository! Documenting my journey on productionizing machine learning projects through DataTalksClub's mlops-zoomcamp

Modules
1. Modelling: Understand MLOps basics, simple linear regression refresher using NYC taxi data.
2. Experiment Tracking and Model Management: Use MLflow to track experiments and manage models.
3. Orchestration and ML Pipelines: Learn about workflow orchestration using Mage.
4. Model Deployment: Explore different deployment methods with Flask, AWS Kinesis, and Lambda.
5. Model Monitoring: Monitor ML-based services with Prometheus and Grafana, and batch jobs with Prefect and MongoDB.

Best Practices: Cover testing, linting, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and infrastructure as code with Terraform.
Work on an end-to-end project applying concepts from all modules.
